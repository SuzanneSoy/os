Tests for the web pages.

* Checks that the pages are valid Polyglot Markup (an HTML5 / XHTML chameleon, TODO link to references)
  * Uses the W3C validator to check that the pages are valid HTML 5, XHTML 1.0, XHTML 1.1, as well as valid HTML 3.2, HTML 4.0 with the exception of the obvious incompatibilities (doctype and self-closing tags)
* Checks that there are no broken links between the pages, and no broken links to external pages.
