  This is an overview of the professions and techniques involved in the creation of interactive multimedia software. It fits well as a welcome guide for new employes, to let them know what the other professions are doing in the company, or as a pamhplet for students interested in joining a school training them for these professions.

## CPU and integrated circuits

* Wikipedia's illustration of a [NAND gate's physical layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS#Example:_NAND_gate_in_physical_layout) clearly shows how NMOS and PMOS transistors are created on a silicon substrate, as well as a schematic representation of the resulting layers.

* Some people have built small integrated circuits (e.g. inverters) at home, using simple equipment: [Jeri Ellsworth](https://hackaday.com/2010/03/10/jeri-makes-integrated-circuits/), [HomeCMOS](https://hackaday.com/2012/07/09/make-your-own-integrated-circuits-at-home/).
* [visual6502.org](http://visual6502.org/), a sumulation of the 6502 CPU based on photos of the silicon die. It features an online zoomable view of the CPU with different colors for the logic states, in which wires and transistors blink as the CPU executes instructions.

* Planck keyboards have only four rows. The first row is usually activated with the thumbs, and all other keys are at most 1 key away from the home row. [![Example layout of a planck keyboard](https://i.imgur.com/cNipMSc.png)](https://i.imgur.com/cNipMSc.png)
* [WASD Keyboards](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/) does full-color print on keycaps. Examples:
